angular-socketio-chatroom-example
=================================

A working chatroom example built with AngularJS and Socket.io.

I fixed the data-binding issue in the Ref.1 which separate the server and client in Ref.4.

Step 1: 
Install the dependencies: 
npm install socket.io express

Step 2: 
Start the server side: node app.js
Then it will be run on http://127.0.0.1:3000

Step 3: 
Start the client side: npm start
It will be run on http://127.0.0.1:8000/app/index.html
